This started as a small personal project that I put on my resume as a simple example of my practice with C++. It has evolved beyond its original scope and will be put into its own repo and create a website with it. If you would like to see the progress of this project, please let me know, and I will direct you to the website once it is up. Of course, this program and still runnable. Feel free to compile and run the  progrma and look in my comments of the files to see what I intended to do further if I didn't change the scope of the project.
