This started as a small personal project that I put on my resume as a simple example of my practice with C++. It has evolved beyond its original scope and will be put into its own repo. View my Personal repo (not the one in my Resume repo; I have 3 main repos: Resume, Previous Works, and Personal) if you would like to see the progress of this project. Of course, this program and still runnable. Feel free to compile and run the  progrma and look in my comments of the files to see what I intended to do further if I didn't change the scope of the project.
