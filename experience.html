            <p>
                The Planetary Exploration Transport Vehicle or PET is a vehicle sponsored by NASA that is designed to
                support future Mars' missions along with any other planetary or lunar mission. The PET should be able to
                tranport people and cargo through surface translation, global hops, and entering and exiting orbit. Due to the
                sponshorship with NASA, I am unable to show very much of the PET; however, I am able to show the parts I contributed
                to. I was on the aerodynamics and propulsion sub-team (A & P) and primarily worked on the Reaction Control System (RCS).

            <a href="./Projects/School Projects/HTML Pages/SpaceCRAFT Research.html">SpaceCRAFT - Research</a></li>
            <p>
                SpaceCRAFT is a virtual reality system made to be a virtual sandbox for a wide range of aerospace projects from
                traversal through space to aerospace maneuvers on various planets and moons and more. I did research for SpaceCRAFT. I was on the 
                aerodynamics and propulsion sub-team (A & P) and began to implement the 2D Panel Method into the physics of the virtual
                reality.

            <a href="./Projects/School Projects/HTML Pages/Chemical Rocket Engine Design.html">Chemical Rocket Engine Design</a>
            <p>
                This project was to design a chemical rocket engine. We were given an unrealistic goal of performance and efficiency that no
                rocket engine has achieved in the past. The real goal was to get as close as possible while showing our professor our process of
                designing the engine. This was a 4 person group project. My main contribution was to the turbopump and pre-burner.

            <p>
                This project deals with the themodynamics of a two-spool turbofan engine.

            <p>
                This project deals with the compressor of a jet engine.

            <a href="./Projects/School Projects/HTML Pages/FEM.html">Finite Element Method (FEM)</a>
            <p>
                This project implements the finite element method (FEM) by reading in from a .txt file, and
                outputting the data to a .txt file.

            <a href="./Projects/School Projects/HTML Pages/Machine Learning.html">Machine Learning</a>
            <p>
                I took a class on artifical intelligence (AI) and machine learning. This project is an application of that using knowledge-based agents and Bayesian nets.

            <a href="./Projects/School Projects/HTML Pages/Protection against Electromagnetic Fields and Radiation using Plasma.html">Protection against Electromagnetic Fields and Radiation using Plasma</a>
            <p>
                I took a class on plasma, and the final project was to do a trade study on the application of plasma. Due to electromagnetic fields and radiation present in space travel,
                I decided to do a trade study on the protection against electromagnetic fields and radiation using plasma.
