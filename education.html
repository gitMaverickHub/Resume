    <p>Explanation: 
        
    College was a rough transition period for me. Before college, school came very easy to me. I never had to study, and I
    was able to finish most of my homework during classes. All of my free time went
    to spending time with my family, friends, and relaxing. I, idiotically, thought it would be the same in college. I
    skipped many classes and did not study at first. Unsurprisingly, I did very poorly. Being alone
    and failing for the first time in my life, depression and anxiety set in for the first time. From there, college
    continued to be a stuggle. I felt like I didn't belong. I lost my first friend to a car accident,
    one of the only friends I made at that point in college. I had my first girlfriend and didn't know how to manage my
    time. I made friends in my classes, but rarely felt close enough to ask for help on the material. I tried to take on too
    much of a course load at a time in order to catch up
    taking 20+ hours semesters. One semester when I was back on a decent course academically, I leanred that I would have to
    take an extra semester in order to get my CSCE minor since my GPA was too low in those classes to recieve it.
    I spiraled that semester, and the next when I took a CSCE course, I had to enroll into a different CSCE course over a
    month in the semester. I got permissions to change courses, but I couldn't catch up
    in that course while keeping up with my others needing to finish 2 projects and homeworks within a 2 week span in a
    course I have not been in.
    
    Talk about depression, anxiety, overloading course load, working, losing my friends, feeling isolated, first death of a
    friend, working hard for the first time,
    learning I would have to take an extra semester because of CSCE, needing to work, grade being pulled down by classes I
    didn't drop or withdraw, and how close I was to being a 3.0. Also, talk about finding the love of my life,
    learning how to split my time, getting married, moving in together, and getting a cat.
