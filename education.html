            <h2>
                Explanation:
            </h2>
            <p>
                All through primary school and high school, I excelled in academics with ease. However, college proved to be a
                challenging transition.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first semester was a difficult adjustment, and my grades reflected the fact that I was struggling. As the first of my
                family to go to a major university, I immediately experienced displacement and pressure. I also lost a dear friend of
                mine to a car accident, and the grief did not pass easily. I did not get treatment for how these events affected me
                mentally and emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw improvements in my second semester, both in my mental health and my grades. But once the COVID pandemic began and
                classes went fully remote, I was faced with another challenging transition. Though I am completely adept at working
                remotely now, it was very difficult at the time, and my mental health suffered worse than I had previously experienced .
                Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 were especially difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Fall 2021 semester, I overloaded my schedule in an attempt to make up for lost time. I was able to pass all
                my classes, but my GPA still suffered. In Spring 2022, I learned that I would have to extend my schooling by another
                semester to meet the newly established computer science requirements for my minor. In Fall of 2022, I was informed that
                some of my computer sciences courses I was advised to attend would not count towards my minor. I then hastily joined
                CSCE 312 to obtain the correct credits, but by that time I was behind on the work. I worked hard to catch up, but in the
                end, CSCE 312 affected my performance in other classes, and I had to withdraw.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that semester, I started getting treatment for my mental health. I learned to manage my symptoms in a healthy and
                productive way, and have no longer needed treatment since Spring of 2023. I have completed and passed my classes from
                that point onward.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, I experienced many challenges during my years at college, but was determined to graduate with my degree and
                both minors. I believe I learned much about myself and my field, and I truly believe I can excel in the field of
                aerospace engineering and computer science. Given the opportunity, I know I will exceed employer's expectations and be a
                valuable asset.
